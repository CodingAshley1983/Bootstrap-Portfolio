                I am a huge fan of music, music festivals and live shows. I've fronted a number of bands as a blues/jazz/soul vocalist. I play guitar, piano and ukulele, and this past summer I added "cigar-box" guitar to my instrumental repetoire when I built an electric guitar out of an 800 page book. I can't wait to make the next one! 

                I'm originally from Upstate NY (nowhere near NYC) and moved to Denver in 2011. 
                <br>I've taken an unintentional hiatus from the music scene and focused on writing my own at home. <br>
                I occasionally find time to jam with other musicians and it makes my soul happy.<br>
                I currently work as an Educational admin/project manager with an incredible, national association for massage therapy.<br>
                
                I work really closely with our IS department and am so looking forward to becoming a web developer and moving into their department.
                <br>Here's to a successful 6-month program and an amazing new career!
